## Overview
This repository contains a voice assistant application built with Django. The application features pitch shift, voice denoise, and hot word detection capabilities in both online and offline modes.

## Features
- **Pitch Shift**: Adjusts the pitch of the voice input.
- **Voice Denoise**: Reduces background noise from the voice input.
- **Hot Word Detection**: Detects specific trigger words in the voice input. Works in both online and offline modes.
